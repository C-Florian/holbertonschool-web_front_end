# Python Variable Annotations

This project aims to introduce and explore the concept of variable annotations and type hinting in Python 3. Type annotations help specify the expected types for function parameters and return values, as well as for variables. They help improve code clarity, readability, and maintainability. Additionally, tools like mypy can be used to validate the types in your code.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand and explain type annotations in Python 3
- Use type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types
- Understand and apply duck typing in Python
- Validate Python code with mypy

## Project Structure

This project consists of several tasks that focus on basic and complex type annotations. Each task requires you to write Python functions with type annotations and test them to ensure proper type handling.

### Tasks

1. **Basic Annotations - add**: Write a function that takes two floats and returns their sum.
2. **Basic Annotations - concat**: Write a function that concatenates two strings.
3. **Basic Annotations - floor**: Write a function that returns the floor of a float.
4. **Basic Annotations - to_str**: Write a function that returns the string representation of a float.
5. **Define Variables**: Define and annotate variables with different types (int, float, bool, string).
6. **Complex Types - List of Floats**: Write a function that takes a list of floats and returns their sum.
7. **Complex Types - Mixed List**: Write a function that takes a list of integers and floats and returns their sum.
8. **Complex Types - String and Int/Float to Tuple**: Write a function that returns a tuple containing a string and the square of a number.
9. **Complex Types - Functions**: Write a function that returns another function to multiply a number.
10. **Duck Typing an Iterable Object**: Annotate a function that takes an iterable of sequences and returns a list of tuples with each sequence and its length.

## Usage

You can run each task's code by executing the respective Python script file. For example, to run Task 1 (add):

```bash
$ python3 0-main.py
